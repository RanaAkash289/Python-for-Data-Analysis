# üçï Pizza Sales Data Analysis with Pandas & NumPy

### üìÑ Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. The primary focus of the analysis is to understand sales trends, the performance of different pizza categories, and the effect of factors like size and promotions (vouchers) on sales. This project aims to provide insights into customer purchasing behavior, including how different pizza sizes and categories perform, and how vouchers influence sales volumes.

### üìÇ Data:
The datasets include:
- **pizza_sales.xlsx**: Contains detailed sales information including order quantities, dates, and payment methods.
- **pizza_category.csv**: Provides information on different pizza categories.
- **pizza_sales_voucher.xlsx**: Includes voucher information related to specific sales.
- **pizza_size.csv**: Contains details about the different sizes of pizzas.
- **another_pizza_sales.xlsx**: Additional sales data for cross-referencing and analysis.

### üõ† Tools Used:
- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used extensively for data cleaning, manipulation, and merging the datasets.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Used for creating visualizations of the data.
- **Excel**: Used for importing and exporting data.

### üîç Key Insights:
- **Sales Trends by Category**: Identified the best-selling pizza categories and compared their sales volumes.
- **Impact of Pizza Size on Sales**: Analyzed how different pizza sizes (small, medium, large) influence customer purchases.
- **Voucher Effectiveness**: Explored how vouchers impact sales volumes and customer behavior.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Looked into how sales fluctuate over time, particularly during promotional periods.

### üìä Visualizations:
1. **Box Plot - Distribution of Sales by Category**:
   - This box plot shows the distribution of pizza sales prices across different categories (Classic, Veggie, Supreme, Chicken).
   - **Key Insights**:
     - **Classic pizzas** exhibit a wider range of prices, with some high-value outliers, suggesting that while they are generally sold at lower prices, they occasionally lead to higher-value transactions.
     - The **Veggie**, **Supreme**, and **Chicken** categories show more consistent price ranges, with fewer extreme outliers.
     - Classic pizzas tend to be more price-flexible, occasionally driving higher sales.
   - **Conclusion**: This visualization highlights how pizza categories differ in pricing, providing insights into which categories are more versatile and profitable.

### üîó Data and Scripts:
- **Source (Input) Data**: Contains all raw input data used for the analysis.
- **Cleaning Scripts**: Includes the Python scripts for cleaning and processing the pizza sales data.
- **Final Outputs**: Contains visualizations and summary data exported from the analysis.
