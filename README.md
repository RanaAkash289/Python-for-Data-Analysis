# 🐍 Python-for-Data-Analysis

### 📄 Description
This project provides a **descriptive analysis** of various MNCs (Multinational Corporations) data using Python. It demonstrates the use of powerful Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, analyze, and visualize data.

### 📝 Introduction
This repository is a comprehensive guide and resource for performing **data analysis** using Python. The project focuses on applying data science techniques to gain insights from MNCs' datasets, including statistical summaries, visualizations, and interpretations of data.

### ✨ Features
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing datasets for accurate analysis.
- 📊 **Statistical Summaries**: Compute statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Create line plots, bar charts, histograms, and more.
- 🧮 **Group-by Operations**: Compare sales across multiple categories.
