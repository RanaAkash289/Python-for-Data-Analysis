## 📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis (India)

### 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of Amazon sales data from India, using **Python** with the **Anaconda** distribution and **Spyder** IDE to extract meaningful insights. The analysis involved cleaning, filtering, and aggregating the data to answer key business questions. The goal was to better understand sales patterns across different categories, fulfillment methods, and shipment statuses.

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used extensively for data manipulation.
- **Anaconda**: Distribution used for managing packages and dependencies.
- **Spyder**: IDE used to write and execute Python scripts.
- **Excel**: For exporting the aggregated results.

### 🏷️ Key Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values by either removing rows with NaNs or filling them where necessary.
- **Data Filtering**: Extract subsets of data based on specific conditions, such as sales amounts greater than 1000 or certain product categories.
- **Data Aggregation**: Group and summarize data by category, fulfillment method, and shipment status.
- **Exporting Results**: Export the final aggregated results to Excel files for reporting and further analysis.

### 🧐 Questions Answered:
1. **How many sales had amounts greater than 1000?**
   - Filtered data to show only sales with amounts exceeding ₹1000.
   
2. **How many sales belong to the category "Tops" and have a quantity of 3?**
   - Filtered data to extract sales that met these specific criteria.

3. **What are the total sales by category?**
   - Grouped sales data by category and calculated the total sales for each.

4. **What is the average amount by category and status?**
   - Grouped by category and status to compute average sales amounts.

5. **What are the total sales by fulfillment and shipment type?**
   - Aggregated data based on fulfillment and shipment types to calculate total sales.

### 📈 Insights Derived:
- **High-value sales (over ₹1000)** were concentrated in specific product categories.
- **The "Tops" category**, with a quantity of 3, accounted for significant sales.
- **Average sales amounts** varied across fulfillment methods and order statuses.
- **Fulfillment and Shipment types** played a key role in the overall sales figures.

### 📂 Data Export:
- **`average_sales_by_Category_and_Status.xlsx`**: Contains the average sales amount by category and status.
- **`total_sales_by_shipmentandfulfil.xlsx`**: Contains total sales figures based on shipment and fulfillment types.

### 🔍 Future Work:
- **Visualization**: Enhance the analysis by visualizing the data using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Implement machine learning techniques to forecast future sales trends.
- **Further Exploration**: Investigate how discounts, customer reviews, and promotions impact sales performance.
