# üìä LendingClub Loan Analysis with Python

### üìÑ Project Overview:
As a data analyst for **LendingClub**, the goal of this project was to build a simple model to predict whether a borrower would pay back their loan in full. The analysis is based on various borrower details such as loan purpose, FICO score, debt-to-income ratio, interest rate, and more. Additionally, I developed visualizations to help understand loan trends, borrower profiles, and the relationship between different loan variables.

### üìÇ Data:
The datasets used in this project include:
- **loandataset.xlsx**: Contains detailed information about loans and borrowers.
- **customer_data.csv**: Provides customer-level data including credit scores and debt ratios.

### üõ† Tools & Libraries:
- **Python**: The core language used for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing data trends and relationships.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for creating predictive models.

### üîç Key Insights:
1. **Loan Purpose Distribution**:
   - The most common purpose for loans is **debt consolidation**, followed by **credit card** and **home improvement**.
   - Smaller purposes, such as **educational** loans, have fewer occurrences in the dataset.

2. **FICO Score Distribution**:
   - The FICO scores of borrowers range from 625 to 825, with a peak around 700, indicating most borrowers have a **good** credit score.

3. **Interest Rate vs. Risk**:
   - Borrowers classified as **high risk** tend to receive higher interest rates, as depicted in the box plot.

4. **Debt-to-Income Ratio vs. FICO Score**:
   - The scatter plot highlights a broad range of debt-to-income (DTI) ratios across various FICO scores, with no clear linear correlation.

5. **Interest Rate vs. Loan Risk**:
   - The box plot clearly shows how **low-risk** borrowers have a median interest rate much lower than **high-risk** borrowers, aligning with typical loan underwriting principles.
